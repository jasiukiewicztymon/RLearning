# R language

To start work with vector we have to understand what is it... Well, a vector is a list of items that are of the same type and you define with `c()` where you pass the init elements inside of the `()`. In the example below you have an example of a vector storing integer.

```r
nums <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
nums
```

```
1 2 3 4
```

If you want to store a sequence inside a vector you can do it by assigning the starting number link by a `:`to the end number. You have an example below.

```r
nums <- 1:5
nums
```

```
1 2 3 4 5
```
